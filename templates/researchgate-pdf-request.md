Dear XXXXXX,

First of all, thank you for your interest in my work!

I do not upload my work to ResearchGate because it is often illegal to do so since they are a for-profit organization. Furthermore, they have the practice of sometimes inserting an extra page advertising their site into the uploaded PDFs. I find this unacceptable.

I keep copies and download links for all my work on my personal website: https://www.leouieda.com

There you will also find links to related publications and other resources like source code, presentations, data, etc. If an article is not already open-access, the website includes links to free open-access preprints or postprints (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) or a link to a PDF if those aren't available.

Best regards,

Leonardo
